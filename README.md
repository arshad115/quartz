This version only works with Obsidian and Github Flavored Markdown. Also cleaned up some unused dependencies.
Performance is improved, node_modules size reduced from 525mb to 290mb. Docker container size reduced from 500mb to 200mb. Can be reduced further if you remove the Graphs, but I like them so kept them.

### Docker image:

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.
